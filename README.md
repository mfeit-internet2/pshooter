pShooter is a tool that automates part of the process of
troubleshooting network problems between two points by running
pScheduler tests to as many perfSONAR nodes as can be found along the
path between them.  It consists of a web service with a [REST
API](API.md) and a [scheme for placing information into the Domain
Name Service](DNS.md) that can
be used to locate perfSONAR nodes in close proximity to the path.

A full description and a demonstration of an early prototype
can be found [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HUY6b5T9DM).
